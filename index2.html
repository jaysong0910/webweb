			<h1>My Autobiography</h1>
			<h2>The Man with full of courage Jayson Llacuna Garcia, 
			was born on the 10th Day of September 2002 in San Agustin, 
			Isabela but currently living at Sto. Domingo, Luna, Isabela 
			and have three siblings- 1 brother and 2sisters they are 
			also helping him in his growth as their parents’ does. 
			In his stage of growing, he had experienced different types 
			of bullying; physical, emotional and in cyber, but bullying 
			doesn’t stop him for doing what is right and good things to 
			others but he is taking it as an additional strengths in 
			making his dreams come true. As how he explained his daily 
			life, he has God on his side, Our Almighty God is helping him 
			to walk uprightly and faithfully everyday, as what the Bible 
			says “Nothing is Impossible”, that all things can be possible 
			if you believe in the name of Jesus and all things can be better, 
			we just need to pray, doing our best all the time and thanking 
			Him for all he has done and to all the things he will going 
			to do for me, to you and to all of us.</h2>
